#Road Curvature Detection Using Edge Detection
'''This repository contains code for detecting road curvature using edge detection techniques. The project aims to assist in autonomous driving systems by accurately determining the curvature of the road ahead'''

<h2>Overview</h2>
The detection of road curvature is a critical aspect of autonomous navigation systems. By analyzing the edges of the road in real-time, this project aims to estimate the curvature of the road and provide valuable information for steering control algorithms.

<h3>Features</h3>
Edge detection using Canny algorithm
Estimation of road curvature based on detected edges

<h4>Visualization of road curvature results</h4>
